## Installation:

### Install script
After downloading/extracting, open a terminal in this directory and execute the install script `./install.sh`  
By default, all variants are installed for the current user and wallpapers are not installed.

* Option `-g` installs globally, needs root privileges
* Option `-v` allows to choose variants (eg. `./install.sh -v "Orange Orange-Dark Mint"`)
* Option `-w` installs wallpapers  
Use `./install.sh -w -v ""` to install only the wallpapers.


### Manual installation
After downloading/extracting, move the `Flatery` and `Flatery-Dark` folders to `/usr/share/icons` if you want them to be visible for all users.  
If you want them to be visible only to your user, move them to `~/.icons` (GTK-based distros) or `~/.local/share/icons` (KDE-based distros).

Similarily move the `Flatery-wallpapers` folder to `/usr/share/wallpapers` or `~/.local/share/wallpapers`.
